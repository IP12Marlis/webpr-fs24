    Your user has entered a new business rule on how to calculate this year's bonuses.
    He entered a formula through a web form and it is available through the _string_ variable 'bonusFormula'.
    The formula refers to the employee as 'employee' like in 'employee.bonus = employee.revenue * 0.2'

    Provide a function (or lambda expression) named 'bonusCalculation' that calculates an employee's bonus by using
    the user-provided bonusFormula.

    Do _NOT_ use the "Function" class.
